Hi, I'm Sri! I'm a Carnegie Mellon University graduate student and I build machine learning systems, data products and pipelines, and mission-driven analytics. My technical foundation spans natural language processing (retrieval-augmented generation, multimodal reasoning, fine-tuning), classical machine learning (time series forecasting, clustering, anomaly detection), and data engineering (SQL databases, API integration, workflow automation). I work at the intersection of technical execution and domain expertise, targetting real operational constraints. I design systems considering deployment context, evaluation under temporal distribution shift, fairness metrics, and implementation feasibility. I focus on domains where data science can support evidence-based decisions in climate and energy policy, finance, public health, urban infrastructure, and justice system reform.

<!-- I'm an Applied Data Scientist focused on classic ML + applied NLP (RAG, multimodal, evaluation) and mission-driven analytics. -->

<!-- I've shipped work across finance, healthcare, climate/energy, and criminal justice — building products, pipelines, and decision support systems that bridge technical execution with real-world impact. -->
