I'm an Applied Data Scientist focused on classic ML + applied NLP (RAG, multimodal, evaluation) and mission-driven analytics.

I've shipped work across finance, healthcare, climate/energy, and criminal justice — building products, pipelines, and decision support systems that bridge technical execution with real-world impact.
